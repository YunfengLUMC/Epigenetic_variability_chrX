# Epigenetic_variability_chrX
This repository contains the scripts (R Markdown files) that were used for the analyses accompanying the manuscript "X chromosome methylation in females displays increased variability with age at regions subject to X-chromosome inactivation".

In this manuscript, we systematic annotated, interpretated of age-related differences in DNA methylation at the X chromosome at the level of both differences in mean (age-related differentially methylated CpGs, aDMCs) and differences in variability (age-related variably methylated CpGs, aVMCs).

The scripts were run in order (from 1 to 10). The purpose of each script is as follows:

Script 1: Prepare X-chromosome methylation data from BIOS biobank.

Script 2: aDMCs identification by double generalized linear model (DGLM).

Script 3: aVMCs identification by double generalized linear model (DGLM).

Script 4: Compare if DGLM results are robust and convincing.

Script 5: aDMCs replication based on two external datasets.

Script 6: aVMCs replication based on two external datasets.

Script 7: Create an annotation file of the Illumina Infinium 450K array with CGI features and XCI status.

Script 8: Fuctional annotatation of XCI related features of aDMCs and aVMCs.

Script 9: Test assocaition between aDMCs/aVMCs methylation and X chromosome gene expression.

Script 10: Identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among replicated aDMCs and aVMCs.
